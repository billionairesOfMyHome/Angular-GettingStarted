# Structural directives

directive 就是自定义的 HTML 标签或属性。我们可以构建自己的 directive（标签），也可以用 Angular 内置的 directive（属性）

We can think of a directive as a custom HTML element or attribute we use to power up and extend our HTML. We can build our own custom directives or use Angular's built‑in directives.

A structural directive modifies the structure or layout of a view by adding, removing, or manipulating elements and their children. 

结构化指令通过增加，移除，精准控制元素和子元素修改视图的结构。

the asterisk in front of the directive name. That marks the directive as a structural directive.

Each time we want to use an Angular directive in a template, we need to consider how to make that directive visible to the Angular compiler.

## *ngFor

The let keyword here creates a variable called product. We can reference this variable anywhere on this element, on any sibling element(同级元素), or on any child element.

for of 迭代 item，for in 迭代 item 的 property

ES 2015 has both a for...of loop and for...in loop. The for...of loop is similar to a foreach‑style loop. **It iterates over an iterable object**, such as an array. For example, say we have an array of persons nicknames. If we use for...of to iterate over this list, we'll see each nickname logged to the council. 

The for...in loop **iterates over the properties of an object**. When working with an array such as this example, the array indexes are enumerable properties with integer names and are otherwise identical to general object properties. So we see each array index logged to the console. To help remember the difference, think of in as iterating the index. 

Since the ngFor directive iterates over iterable objects, not their properties, Angular selected to use the of keyword in the ngFor expression.
