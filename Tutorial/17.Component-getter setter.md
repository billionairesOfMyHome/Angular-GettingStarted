# define a property in a class

## declare a variable for a property

将属性定义成变量并直接读写

Think of this simple variable property as a piggybank（存钱罐）. We can put money directly into the piggybank or take money out of the piggybank.

## define a property with a JavaScript getter and setter

使用 getter 和 setter 定义 property，可以在 getter，setter  中做数据预处理，如 getter 中做货币转换，格式转换，setter 中打印数据或更新总余额

Think of a getter and setter as a bank. We set money into our account, the bank processes the amount, and holds the money in a private vault somewhere. When we want to get that amount, the bank needs to get the money from private storage before it can return that amount. 

定义一个 private 变量 store getter setter 的值，叫做 a backing variable.

When creating a getter and setter, we often define a private storage variable called a backing variable to store the value managed by the getter and setter. We use the private keyword to denote that this backing variable is private and should only be managed by the getter and setter. To help us recognize this variable as private, by convention, we prefix it with an underscore. In the getter, we return the amount from private storage, optionally processing that amount before returning it.

getter setter 中，像 simple variable 一样，用 this.amount 读写值。需要读之前做数据转换（货币转换，格式转换），可以在 getter 中处理。需要在写值之后做处理（打印数据或更新总余额），可以在 setter 中处理。

we can write code to process the value when its get or set. We access these properties just like simple variable properties, using this to reference the class and then the property name.

setter 只有一个参数，就是给这个 property 的值。每当值分配给 property，都会执行 setter，因此，可以使用 setter 在 property  更改时执行操作，例如过滤产品列表。

The setter has a single parameter, which is the value assigned to the property. The setter has no return value. The setter is executed any time a value is assigned to the associated property, so we can use the body of the setter to perform an operation when the property is changed such as filtering our list of products. 

# getter setter 例子

改写 listFilter，当 listFilter 改变时，filter product list

If we use a getter and setter for the list filter, we can write code that filters the list of products every time the filter string is set.

注意：在 class 中，直接访问 private backing variable（this.\_listFilter），可以访问的到，但是不会执行 setter，只有像 simple variable一样访问（this.listFilter）才会执行 setter。除了本 class 以外，其他任何地方都不能访问 private 变量，template 也不行。
