# Keywords

## Components

## Templates, data binding, directives

power up that user interface with data binding and nicely format our data with **pipes**（比如钱币 format ￥13，$8）. 

## Services, dependency injection

## Http, observables

## Navigation, routing

## Angular CLI

# Anatomy（解析） of an Angular Application

## application = 

application = components + services

## 划分组件

一般一个页面划分为一个 component

一些可重用的组件也可划分为一个component，比如评价组件（star component）、搜索组件（text box 和 search button）、密码验证组件（text boxes 和 validation logic）

# TypeScript

The JavaScript language specification standard is officially called ECMAScript, or ES. The ES6 specification was renamed ES 2015 and introduced many key new features, such as classes and arrow functions.

Any newer JavaScript features that we use but a browser doesn't support must first be transpiled. What does that mean? Newer JavaScript features in our code must be compiled by a tool that converts the newer JavaScript syntax to comparable older syntax before the browser executes it. 

TypeScript code transpiles to plain JavaScript. What does that mean? Code developed with TypeScript must be compiled and converted to comparable JavaScript syntax before the browser executes it. That way, we as developers get the benefits of TypeScript features during development and the browsers still get code they understand. One of the key benefits of TypeScript is its **strong typing**, meaning that everything has a data type. Because of this strong typing, TypeScript has great tooling, including inline documentation, syntax checking, code navigation, and advanced refactorings, so TypeScript helps us better reason about our code. And TypeScript implements the ES 2015 class‑based object orientation, plus more. It implements classes, interfaces, and inheritance. So if you have experience with an object‑oriented programming language such as C#, C++, or Java, using TypeScript may feel very natural to you.

概括：使用 TypeScript，开发者可以充分利用 TypeScript 的优点，（工具（什么工具））将 TypeScript 转译为纯 JavaScript。浏览器也能理解并执行 JavaScript。TypeScript 最关键的优点就是强类型，这使 TypeScript 具有出色的工具，包括内联文档、语法检查、代码导航和高级重构，因此 TypeScript 可以帮助我们更好地维护代码，TypeScript 实现了 ES 2015 基于类的面向对象，类、接口和继承，帮助我们写出更优雅的代码。

# npm

Node package manager, you can think of npm as two things. First, it's an online registry or repository of open source and free libraries and packages. It contains many JavaScript packages, such as Angular, TypeScript, and Bootstrap, which is a web styling framework. Second, npm is a command line utility for interacting with that repository. We can type commands, such as npm install some library name. Npm will locate the specified library in the repository and install it on your local machine in a subfolder of the current folder named node_modules.

概况：npm 是一个存储库和命令行工具，该工具可用于访问存储库。Npm 已成为 JavaScript 应用的包管理器。我们可以使用 npm安装库、包以及它们的依赖项。我们需要 npm 来安装 Angular 的所有库。

# package.json

Define a package.json file that lists each package we need for our Angular application. We can also specify the desired version of each package. We then tell npm to use the package.json file to install all of the defined packages along with their dependencies. By defining a package.json file for our Angular application, we ensure everyone on the team installs the appropriate packages and versions. 

概况：npm 根据 package.json 指定的包和版本下载相应版本的包和所有依赖。

## dependencies list

The dependencies list is for the packages we need for development that must also be deployed, includes the primary Angular packages, along with supporting packages, such as RxJS for working with data. 

概括：dependencies 用于开发且部署所需的包

## devDependencies list

The devDependencies list is for the packages we only need for development. The devDependencies include the Angular CLI. TypeScript is here in the devDependencies since we transpile the code to JavaScript before deployment, and many of these are for unit code tests. 

概括：devDependencies 用于开发所需的包。
